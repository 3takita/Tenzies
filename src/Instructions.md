- Challenge:
-
- Create state to hold our array of numbers. (Initialize
- the state by calling our `allNewDice` function so it
- loads all new dice as soon as the app loads)
-
- Map over the state numbers array to generate our array
- of Die elements and render those in place of our
- manually-written 10 Die elements.
